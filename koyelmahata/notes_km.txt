While installing masyter got below logs :
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 10.123.1.39:6443 --token i9m9ta.b59wi061fc4u2me3 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2ad06066d7af4edd2783c7edd2c568d391a3d048f6d410832f05eae94958c9a0


Node mechine setup:
=================================
Intstall docker in node system

https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/setting-up-kubernetes-clusters-using-kubeadm-manual-way-in-rhel-7-centos7/
Run only steps 5 6 7 for installing kubernets in node mechine.

Then for join run below command 
kubeadm join 10.123.1.39:6443 --token i9m9ta.b59wi061fc4u2me3 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2ad06066d7af4edd2783c7edd2c568d391a3d048f6d410832f05eae94958c9a0
    
Can set as many nodes as you can.

Below logs will come while joining nodes with master:
	[root@ip-10-123-1-244 ~]# kubeadm join 10.123.1.39:6443 --token i9m9ta.b59wi061fc4u2me3 \
>     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2ad06066d7af4edd2783c7edd2c568d391a3d048f6d410832f05eae94958c9a0
